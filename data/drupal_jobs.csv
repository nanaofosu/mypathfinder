We have a need for a Web Developer, as we look to build resilience in our capacity for our back-end development team and continue to build that team’s skills over the long term. This is a full-time position and will report directly to one of our Development Managers.



We’re regularly building new websites for our clients, as well as maintaining and upgrading existing ones. You’ll be a key part of that process, working closely with our project management, UX, design, development, QA, and content teams to deliver amazing projects that directly impact the lives of others. This role is key to our continued growth and our clients’ success.



Ideally, you’ve had a fair amount of experience developing in PHP or a similar language, and have built some powerful things in systems like Symfony, Drupal, or WordPress. You can solve a problem multiple ways and speak knowledgeably about pluses and minuses of each solution, understand that reinventing the wheel isn’t a sustainable strategy for projects, take your documentation seriously, and have a history of delivering quality sites. You’re at ease writing well-structured and clean code, understand how to get the most out of your local development environment, are comfortable working in version control, and can deliver quality code reviews to coworkers. You’ll provide thoughtful estimates, determine what is possible to accomplish within a given budget, have an understanding of how timelines are impacted by complexity of features, but can still manage your timelines to deliver quality work. After reviewing scope and acceptance criteria for the project, you can provide a realistic picture of what’s possible and where we may need to make adjustments. You can troubleshoot issues effectively and can identify opportunities for improvement.



As a member of the development team, you’ll be responsible for things like developing tools that help run businesses, integrating with third-party tools, interacting with APIs, improving site performance through code, and helping our clients achieve their business goals. Not only will you be writing PHP and JavaScript for various web applications, you’ll also be integral in working with team members to architect, build, and implement the components necessary to accomplish the needs of the project. Working with our other teams to deliver amazing projects that directly impact the lives of others is key to this role, and you’ll be a big part of our continued growth and our clients’ success.

 **What We’re Looking For**



To be a great fit for this role, you should have:


* Proficiency in a programming language like PHP, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, or C# (bonus points for PHP and JS)
* A clear understanding of MVC fundamentals and experience with MVC frameworks
* Ability to proficiently use Git and understand different workflows for version control
* Experience with architecting web applications in a manner that supports long-term use and continued growth
* Knowledge of how to approach refactoring or upgrading a project, and how to plan for a successful delivery
* A working knowledge of application security and how to protect code from being exploited
* Great communication skills, regardless of the medium
* Enough knowledge to be able to work without needing to lean on other developers regularly, but also know when to reach out to others for assistance
* A strong desire to improve yourself and continue learning
* Someone that actively supports their teammates and likes to work collaboratively




**How We Work**



We vary our approach and workflow depending on the needs of a project. Sometimes that means working in a waterfall style, sometimes in an agile style, or somewhere in between. Clean and concise coding, proper commenting, and maintaining external documentation is important. We need to remain flexible, but following established standards and maintaining good order for each project is important, as we can’t always guarantee that the same developer will always be working on a project.



Projects occasionally may need you to fly solo, but more often than not, you’ll need to collaborate with other team members for work assigned. We routinely bounce between text chat, video chat, and screen sharing, so being available for a quick chat or a sprint planning meeting is desirable. While there may be reasons to work slightly different hours than the rest of the team, you do need to keep communication levels high and be available for mentoring, code review sessions, or planning activities.

 **Who You Are**



You love the web and have a history of developing websites or applications. You’re most likely a developer with a few years experience in the industry already, or have equivalent development experience outside of a traditional job. If you have a passion for building for the web and share our values, we’d love to hear from you.

 **Who We Are**



SiteCrafting is a full-service digital agency. Our mission is to craft digital experiences that inspire, empower, and delight. Our team of project managers, designers, developers, usability experts, and web strategists have been crafting award-winning web projects since 1998. We are based in downtown Tacoma, WA, and currently have over 30 full-time employees that support clients across a wide variety of industries.

 **Where We Work**



We’re headquartered in downtown Tacoma, WA, but tend to work in a hybrid manner, with some of the team being in the office everyday, some coming in a couple days each week, some coming in for specific events or meetings every so often, but working remotely is something we all do at some level. We currently do not have any requirements for coming into our office to perform work, nor are we expecting that to change. While we’d love to have you in-person at the office, we know that may not always be possible. As long as you’re a resident of WA state and legally allowed to work in the United States, we’re happy to have you join our team remotely. We are unable to sponsor or assume sponsorship of an employment Visa at this time.

 **Compensation & Benefits**



This is a full-time, salaried position with an annual salary in the range of **$65,000-$82,000**, depending on experience and qualifications. In addition to salary, all employees receive 160 hours of paid time off per year, roughly 10 days of office closures (depending on where holidays fall on the calendar), a continuing education budget, and funds available for specific hardware requests. After 90 days of full time employment, we offer medical, dental, employee assistance plan (EAP), vision, and life insurance. After six months of full time employment, we offer 401(k) with matching.

 **Equal Opportunity**



SiteCrafting is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We prohibit discrimination and harassment of any kind based on race, color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other protected characteristic as outlined by federal, state, or local laws.



This policy applies to all employment practices within our organization, including hiring, recruiting, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, leave of absence, compensation, benefits, training, and apprenticeship.

**Department: Development**


***The Role:***



While we already have a number of Craft developers on our team, we're looking for more. We’re growing!



Our projects vary in size and often include features and functionality that go beyond traditional brochure sites with a simple CMS. We integrate our client’s sites with a variety of systems, services, and APIs, such as e-commerce, search engines, CRMs and marketing automation tools, digital asset management systems, ERP systems, and more.



The focus of this role is on backend development, writing custom Craft (or other CMS and platform) plugins and other code that integrates external APIs and systems. You should be comfortable with frontend skills like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as well.

We’re a fast-paced agency with a great team environment, so you’ll never get bored. We need someone who loves keeping up-to-date on the newest advancements in the field and can figure out when to start applying those advancements to client work. You'll work with other smart developers who can help you grow and challenge you, as well as help you along the way.

***Key Responsibilities:***


* Building new applications, websites, and features with a variety of platforms including Craft CMS, Laravel, and more.
* Contributing to high-level architecture planning, consulting with our internal team on approach and level of effort, directing more junior developers.
* Flexing your muscles on aspects of application development outside of app code: database modeling, query optimization, setting up efficient logging and monitoring solutions, and other advanced requirements for highly functioning apps (you do not need to be a DBA/Systems Administrator/DevOps expert).
* Working closely with our front-end and back-end development teams on website projects. We’ll want and expect your input on the best ways to structure the build — from start to finish.
* Writing and maintaining clear documentation of your work, so that others on the team can pick up where you left off or learn from your experience on a project.
* Staying up-to-date on the latest development technologies and methodologies.


***Skills & Qualifications:***


* You should have a minimum of 5 years of professional experience, preferably in a technical role.
* Deep knowledge of PHP and web application architecture (experience with other languages, such as Python, Ruby, Node, etc. are a plus as well)
* Previous Craft CMS (or ExpressionEngine, Drupal, WordPress, other PHP-based CMS) experience
