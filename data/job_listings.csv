**[REMOTE] Regional Sales Manager – Engineered Materials Description**

Our client, a materials engineering industry leader, is looking for a Remote Regional Sales Manager to oversee their Midwest Territory. You’ll be responsible for driving volume growth of engineered plastics within the industrial and consumer goods space. This territory used to be managed by their President, so you’ll have a well-established account base on Day 1 (50% hunting, 50% account management). To be chosen for this role, you must have a proven track record working across Engineering Teams during material selection. Whether you have sales experience or have been in the field as a service engineer and are looking for a chance to prove yourself, they’re looking for someone who enjoys versatility and doesn’t want to just be an order-taker. Instead, someone who wants to learn the ins and outs of their formulations and material performance while ultimately leveraging that understanding to create more credibility and buy-in from engineering teams to win projects. Someone who can build the right value proposition beyond a price, focusing more on quality, service, and delivery. You’ll have the best of both worlds – the security of a billion-dollar global parent company with the tight-knit culture of a smaller US Team. Less organizational layers for you to cut through resulting in quicker decision times with more upward mobility. Their President shared, “We like to help people build careers.” This role will require significant travel so if you’re looking to be less of that “road warrior” at this stage in your career, this would not be the right fit. However, if you still enjoy the grind and want to prove yourself to a global company that has more opportunities for career growth than their competitors, don’t miss your chance.
